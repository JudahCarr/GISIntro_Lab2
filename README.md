# GISIntro_Lab2
In this lab, you will learn how to represent various indicators of demography (e.g. total population, percentage living in poverty, etc.) using four different types of maps: a choropleth map with graduated colors, a bivariate choropleth map, a map with graduated symbols, and a dot density map. The lab manual and shapefile you will utilize to create these maps can be found below, download both to your local desktop (don't forget to unzip the shapefile folder - extract all). 

# Learning Objectives:
- Import a shapefile into ArcGIS Pro (completed in Lab #1)
- Create a choropleth map using graduated colors.
- Create a bivariate choropleth map using two variables (attributes).
- Create a graduated symbol map.
- Create a dot density map.
- Use your maps to answer a critical thinking question.
# *Your final submission should include four maps and answers to each question that is highlighted in purple within the lab manual.*
